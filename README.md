## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tahmid, and I am interested in the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology!
- Iâ€™m currently working on:
    - A research lab at ASU recreating plots from a paper using MATLAB that discussed how growth feedback influences the functions of memory circuits. 
    - Capstone Project (check it out here: https://github.com/TahmidAnwar/Capstone-Project.git)
      
- I have previously worked on:
    - A Bioinformatics project for my class (check it out here: https://github.com/TahmidAnwar/Bioinformatics_class_project.git).
    - A Bioinformatics project for my internship at TGen (check it out here: https://github.com/TahmidAnwar/TGen_Project.git).
    - Wetlab project at my research lab which involved the use of BioBrick cloning techniques.
    - Wetlab work as a member of ASU iGem 2023 team.
      
- My programming language experience: Python, Java, R, MATLAB, Bash.
